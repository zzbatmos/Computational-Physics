Online teaching/learning in Fall 2020 due to COVID pandemic:
Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, most of the courses of UMBC for the Fall 2020 semester will be offered online. Moreover, many incoming international students are not able to get visa and come to UMBC. All this creates a lot of challenges for teaching and learning. To migrate these challenges, this course will be delivered both synchronously and asynchronously to accommodate students from different time zones and/or with different technology accessibility. In addition, online collaboration tools, e.g., Slack or Microsoft Teams, will be used for office hour and discussion.

Synchronous Teaching/Learning through for students already in the United States: Time:	Wed and Fri 1:00 - 2:15PM
Format:	WebEx (see information below)

Academic Integrity By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC's scholarly community in which everyone's academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To read the full Student Academic Conduct Policy, consult the UMBC Student Handbook, the Faculty Handbook, or the UMBC Policies section of the UMBC Director.

Student Disability Services (SDS) UMBC is committed to eliminating discriminatory obstacles that may disadvantage students based on disability. Services for students with disabilities are provided for all students qualified under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, the ADAAA of 2009, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act who request and are eligible for accommodations. The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate accommodations that would allow students to have equal access and inclusion in all courses, programs, and activities at the University. If you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations, please refer to the SDS website at sds.umbc.edu for registration information and to begin the process, or alternatively you may visit the SDS office in the Math/Psychology Building, Room 212. For questions or concerns, you may contact us through email at disAbility@umbc.edu or phone (410) 455-2459. If you require accommodations for this class, make an appointment to meet with me to discuss your SDS-approved accommodations.
